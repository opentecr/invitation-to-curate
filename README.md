# Invitation to recurate the NIST TECR database

Dear reader,

We are inviting you to join a curation effort, with the final goal to digitalize the "Goldberg reviews" completely into a nice format.

The Goldberg reviews are a big collection of structured information about primary scientific literature, which report on apparent equilibrium constants and the experimental conditions they were measured in. 

As you might know, there is an online database ([https://randr.nist.gov/](https://randr.nist.gov/)) and some csv files ([https://zenodo.org/records/5495826](https://zenodo.org/records/5495826)), but we want to consolidate those and make sure we really captured ALL the information from the PDFs. 

We estimated that we need a total of 50 working hours to bring the data into a good shape, and possibly work further from this to bring it into excellent shape.

A peer-reviewed publication in the Nucleic Acid Research journal's database issue is planned, with submission in August.

The work itself is rather simple, but very important.

It would be great if you can contribute. The smallest time blocks needed are ~10 minutes, and you can go on as long as you want. ;)


Thanks so much in advance for your support! And hope to hearing from you soon with questions on the annotation. :)

Best,
